iSDSMcKWOOY,How to make an outboard motor stand,Public,"In this video I show how to make a timber stand for servicing and moving outboard motors. I'll go through a few simple woodworking techniques that find quite handy and in the end we'll have a complete trolley that you'll see in plenty of motor servicing videos to come!

Oh, and I found the link to ""Internet Dude"" here: http://forums.iboats.com/forum/boat-repair-and-restoration/boat-restoration-building-and-hull-repair/272755-building-an-o-b-motor-stand-instructional"
wWDeZKKlwzg,The Yamaha 50HP four stroke finally arrives,Public,"In this video we see the Yamaha outboard that I am going to be repairing over the coming weeks finally arrive on the motor stand. This both provides some nice closure to the Making an Outboard Stand video as well as giving a glimpse of what is to come. It is fair to say it is more of a blog entry than a tutorial, but I hope you get something out of it none the less!

NK2xarQE4yQ,How to fix a submerged two-stroke outboard motor,Public,In this video I show how to repair a 15HP Yamaha two stroke motor that had been on a boat that sunk. We go through cleaning up a submerged battery and then cleaning all the water out of the motor and getting it restarted. If your outboard motor has been underwater this is the video for you.
r9n-HU8ADuY,Removing the powerhead from a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor,Public,"WARNING! I should have said this in this video, but be very careful using head on the flywheel. You don't want to distort it and you don't want to melt any of the wiring beneath it. 

In this video I go through removing the powerhead from the Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard I am repairing. This covers the removal of the flywheel and the powerhead itself."
F8pytHbhZag,Removing the power trim tilt unit from an outboard motor,Public,"In this video I remove the power trim tilt unit from a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor. This includes removing the lower cowling as well as dropping the gearbox (or ""lower unit"") off the leg.

I'm starting to think that people watching this video are looking for information on converting a trim-tilt motor to a manual lift in the case where it has failed and is too expensive to replace. If this is the case leave me a comment and I'll see if I can do a conversion video soon."
GV-Gd9il9MA,Removing the steering bracket (tilt tube) from an outboard motor,Public,"*** I now have a video where I successfully repair an outboard with this problem: https://youtu.be/dJpw9IJ9H1U ***

In this video I (attempt to) repair the steering bracket of a Yamaha 50HP four stroke. The steering is completely seized and unfortunately turns out to be unrepairable so I'll be revisiting various methods of un-seizing outboard steering once the replacement unit arrives. There is still plenty see in this video relating to the disassembly of the mid section, but all up you couldn't call it a good day in the office with regards to the outcome..."
_j2xD_8k5yo,Lubricating stiff outboard throttle and gear control cables,Public,"In this video I show how to lubricate marine cables that are stiff or seized. This technique is great for lubricating throttle cables, gear shift cables and steering cables. Ideally it would be used as part of a preventative maintenance program but it can also be used to help free cables that are starting to seize from corrosion. The cables are common with a variety of inboard and outboard boat motors. 

The technique I show here involves using a simple compressor (or even a bike pump) to force oil down the entire length of the cable."
wbXbiN8ZVcU,Subscribe To Dangar Marine!,Private,"Hi there, I'm DangarStu and this channel is for my marine related videos. They cover a wide range of topics from outboard maintenance and repair, and electrics to rope work to boat handling. Throughout the course of these videos we'll look at most aspects of maintaining and using a small motorboat."
B-iSP9TYPyg,Performing a compression test on the Yamaha 50HP outboard motor.,Public,"This video is a follow-up to the leak down test I performed on this same motor. I wasn't feeling very confident about the results I got from that test so went back to a good old compression test to see what results that gave me. This video shows how to perform a compression test on a Yamaha four stroke outboard. 

A compression test is an excellent way to assess the general health of a motor. If you don't have good compression (around 120 PSI), or the pressure in the cylinders varies widely then there isn't much point look at other problems until that is fixed. Low compression can be caused by worse piston rings, a blown head gasket or valves that aren't seating properly (in a four stroke).

Here is a video on fixing the valves: https://youtu.be/zc7hBgTyQTY

Here is a video on replacing the head gasket: https://youtu.be/rEMFx0Dm3LQ

Here is a video on replacing the rings: https://youtu.be/tFddlbPwC5U"
dtETHoja8QI,Performing a leak-down test on the Yamaha 50HP outboard motor.,Public,"In this video I show how to perform a leak-down test on the Yamaha 50HP outboard motor. So far it is looking like there is a burnt out exhaust valve on cylinder one and maybe two, but we'll find out for sure in a future video when I pull the head off this outboard.

This video is a follow-up to the leak down test I performed on this same motor. I wasn't feeling very confident about the results I got from that test so went back to a good old compression test to see what results that gave me."
Lzn-nshSlwk,How to pressure test an outboard gearbox to check the oil seals for leaks,Private,"In this video I show how to change the oil in an outboard gearbox and also do a pressure test to check if the oil seals are still okay. This test is performed with a homemade tool that is much cheaper than the commercial tools. Pressure is provided using a simple bike pump and some vacuum hose with a T-piece. A cheap pressure gauge is used to measure the results.

By performing this test before you put oil back in the gearbox you can be confident that your outboard motor gearbox is in good condition. If this test does detect a leak you will be able to fix it before water gets into the gearbox. It might take you a little bit of work to put new oil seals in, but that is much better than having a water damaged gearbox down the track!"
rEMFx0Dm3LQ,How to remove the cylinder head from a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor,Public,"In this video I remove the cylinder head from the Yamaha 50HP four stroke to begin investigating why the compression is low on cylinders one and two. We go through the basic procedure of removing the carburettors, timing belt, oil pump, fuel pump and then the head itself.

See this video for the process to remove the powerhead from the outboard before removing the cylinder head:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9n-HU8ADuY&list=UUBsXuIe0nBO3Bi2JmtVk1ZQ"
zc7hBgTyQTY,How to clean and lap valves,Public,"In this video I remove the valves from the cylinder head of a 50HP Yamaha four stroke outboard motor, clean them (and the cylinder head itself) then lap them. I also remove the valve seals and remains of the internal anodes from the water jackets.

This video shows the removal of the cylinder head: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEMFx0Dm3LQ"
IqNk4P94wOs,Changing the impeller on the Yamaha 50HP outboard water pump,Public,"In this video I install a full water pump kit including the impeller in a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor.

TSpE-vskhB0,Reassembling the cylinder head on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard,Public,"In this video I install new valve seals and then replace the valves on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard. I then reinstall the cam shaft and rocker assembly as well as install new internal anodes.

This process is a part of fixing an outboard (like this one) that had low compression due to its valves being bad."
tFddlbPwC5U,Changing the Piston Rings on a Yamaha 50HP Four Stroke outboard,Public,"In this video I remove the pistons and replace all the rings. It covers from opening the crankcase to sealing it back up. See the video ""How to remove the cylinder head from a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor"" (http://youtu.be/rEMFx0Dm3LQ?list=UUBsXuIe0nBO3Bi2JmtVk1ZQ) for that part of the process.

This video includes measuring and positioning the ring gaps as well as removing the old rings and cleaning the pistons.

Once you're finished see this video on reassembly: https://youtu.be/1tkuBGBRbrQ"
yHOOyGxSY90,Changing the crankshaft oil seals on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard,Public,"In this video I replace the oil seals on the crankshaft from a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard motor. Installing the top seal involves removing the driving sprocket for the timing belt. Once the seals are replaced the crankshaft is reinstalled and the crankcase is sealed up again. This operation is normally performed when the outboard is leaking oil down the drive shaft.

The crankcase is opened and the pistons removed in a previous video called ""Changing the piston rings on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard "" (http://youtu.be/tFddlbPwC5U?list=UUBsXuIe0nBO3Bi2JmtVk1ZQ)"
1tkuBGBRbrQ,Installing the cylinder head on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard,Public,In this video I put the cylinder head back onto the block of the Yamaha F50 four stroke outboard motor. One of the head bolts was just spinning so I ended up tapping it out an extra millimetre and buying a bigger bolt. This video picks up from that point onwards and goes through attaching the driven sprocket and the timing belt too.
MBro3wWuCL8,Installing a power trim tilt unit in an outboard motor,Public,"In this video I reinstall the power trim tilt unit that I had previously removed from my Yahama F50 four stroke.

In this further video I show how to connect the wires to the relay: https://youtu.be/VYB4unYt8xQ"
VYB4unYt8xQ,Installing the powerhead on a Yamaha 50HP four stroke outboard,Public,In this video I reinstall the powerhead on the Yamaha F50 four stroke and start it up! The idle is a bit high and a little rough so I will be doing a follow-up video on balancing the carburettors and adjusting the linkages.
e1h-blqDm4U,"Outboard won't crank or turn over, electric start not working",Public,"So you've just turned the key and nothing happens. In this video we look at all the reasons why an outboard with an electric start might not turn over. This can be caused by something as simple as a flat battery or range from faulty switches and blown fuses to a bad starter motor or even a seized engine. With a simple multimeter and a few ideas you'll be able to figure out why your outboard won't crank in no time.

If your motor is cranking but not running, then take a look at this video on the next step in the diagnostic process: https://youtu.be/rXNXzs5Ggjs"
rXNXzs5Ggjs,How to diagnose an outboard that won't start,Private,"!!!NOTE!!! Improved audio version at https://youtu.be/nil7mx3x63k


In this video I show the way I approach and outboard that is turning over (cranking) but not starting. This video is a quick overview of all the things to look for such as fuel, compression and spark. There are lots of things that go wrong with and outboard motor, but hopefully this video will help you narrow down the cause of your problem and help you find a solution.

For a video on what to do if an outboard isn't turning over at all see this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1h-blqDm4U

During this video I talk about the general things I look for when troubleshooting an outboard motor that won't start . I am going to be putting the detail for each type of problem in separate video, so think of this video as an overview of some of the common things that can go wrong.

ZJxwH_MsY58,Positioning a bilge pump and float switch in a boat,Public,"This video is a quick tip on choosing where to place your bilge pump when you install it. Incorrect positioning of a bilge pump can lead to the pump running without picking up any water and therefore draining your battery - possibly resulting in the boat sinking. For this reason it is critical to think about how you arrange them when you install them in your boat.

For information on how to wire a bilge pump and float switch see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qqFdIUj30"
dJpw9IJ9H1U,Fixing a stiff steering bracket (pivot tube) on an outboard motor,Public,"In this video I look at how to free up a stiff or seized steering bracket on an outboard. This is a common problem where the grease that gets put into a pivot tube solidifies around the bushings making the outboard hard to turn. This video explores a couple of ways of fixing it. 

We first try using compressed air to force degreaser into the pivot tube and then some oil. Eventually I completely disassemble the bracket and use a Dremmel to clean out all the old crud and corrosion, grease it and reassemble. The result is a steering bracket that once again turns smoothly and easily!

juhri_NxQcQ,How to make a Direct Voltage Adapter (DVA) to test CDI ignition,Public,"In this video I make up a Direct Voltage (Peak Voltage) Adapter for testing CDI ignition systems. This is a simple circuit that is quick to put together and can save quite a bit of money over making a commercial one. 

For a video on using this adapter see: http://youtu.be/MDbvkFM1V_c

A Direct Voltage Adapter is used to measure the peak voltage coming out of a primary coil and a pulse or trigger coil. This is an important step when diagnosing a problem with an outboard as it can often he hard to tell the quality of the spark you are getting, or where the problem lies if you aren't getting any spark at all. I will be doing a complete follow up video on using this device soon.

The capacitor is a 22uF 400V, R1 is 300 ohms and R2 is 1M ohm.
!!! UPDATE !!! For testing ignition coils R1 needs to be by passed. 

Here is the forum thread I used to source the design: http://forums.iboats.com/forum/engine-repair-and-maintenance/johnson-evinrude-outboards/380403-how-to-make-a-dva-adapter-for-multimeter

IQm5ZGlz5jw,Changing the steering wheel on a boat,Public,"Pimp My Tinnie - Part 1

In this video I change the steering wheel on The Green Machine. The original wheel had been on there for many, many years and was quite stuck so I had to resort to some destructive methods of removal. It was worth it though as the new steering wheel makes the boat feel so much better to drive. :)

During this video I use a bit of penetrating oil, a puller, a slide hammer and ultimately a drill to overcome the corrosion. By using these techniques in order you can ramp up your efforts until you get your steering wheel off. Changing a steering wheel is one of the quickest ways to make your boat more fun to drive so why not give it a go?"
-4rcsEOECPk,Beginner's guide to driving a small boat,Public,"In this video I go through the basics of driving an outboard-powered runabout boat (or ""tinnie"" as we call them locally.) This includes judging your speed, leaving and approaching a pontoon, manoeuvring in a confined space, navigating in a channel and driving between moorings. We also explore techniques such as using a deck line to spring on or off a pontoon when weather gets bad. This is a great way to avoid running into trouble when the wind picks up as it does by the end of this video.

If you are new to boating and looking for a few pointers before heading out on the water this video is a good place to start, but even if you are more experienced you might still learn something from this one. Learning to handle a boat can be a lot of fun, and there is always something new to discover so be sure to post your own tips in the comments as well!

CHfmlm9QJzg,Raising a sunk boat,Public,"In this video I head out on the water with a friend of mine, Peter, to rescue his aluminium punt that has sunk. We use the age-old technique of hooking a line to the stem and then dragging it up onto the plane. This particular hull didn't want to play nicely but we got it there in the end. There are many ways we could have salvaged this boat, but often this way is the quickest and easiest depending on what equipment you have on hand."
ye_Ui9D8dBE,Cleaning a carburettor from an outboard motor,Public,"In this video I clean the carburettor from a Yamaha 15HP two stroke motor. This is a relatively simple process that only needs common hand tools. Many problems with outboard motors are caused by dirty or water in the carburettor and can be fixed completely by following this process. The video starts with removing the carburettor from the outboard then disassembling it. Once sprayed with a bit of carburettor cleaner and compressed air it is put back together, ready for action."
MDbvkFM1V_c,No spark? How to test CDI ignition on an outboard motor,Public,"See this video for information on making a DVA: https://youtu.be/juhri_NxQcQ

In this video I go through testing the CDI ignition on and outboard motor to diagnose any faults such as a no spark situation. This involves testing the resistance of the coils and leads as well as using DVA with a multimeter to measure the voltage coming out of the charge coil, pulser coil and CDI unit itself."
mzWAI2xRGKk,Painting an outboard cowling,Public,"Pimp My Tinnie - Part 2

This video is a bit of fun -- more of a video blog than a tutorial. In it I paint the cowling from the Green Machine and add a few decals to it. My original plan was to Vinyl wrap it but a few tests showed it wasn't going to give the look I was going for so I ended up pulling out the rattle cans again."
0FWu4_EDduQ,The Direct Voltage Adapter (DVA) Revisted,Public,"In this video I make a slight change to the DVA I made in this video: https://youtu.be/juhri_NxQcQ

The modification is to optionally bypass the resister between the diode and the capacitor in order to decrease the time taken to charge the capacitor. This modification is essential to test the output voltage of a CDI unit."
WT9Q8e8bY1g,How to splice an eye in a rope,Public,"In this video I show how to splice an eye into a three-strand rope. I have died the ends of the rope to hopefully make it easier to see. Splicing is relatively easy to learn but all those strands can make it easy to go cross eyed!

Spliced eyes are great for making permanent loops in ropes or making a rope permanently attached to something such as a fire bucket or an anchor chain."
VJ8UruO-_a0,Replacing the steering cable and helm in a boat,Public,"In this video I replace a Teleflex / SeaStar steering cable and helm. This involves removing the old cable, removing the steering wheel and helm and installing the new ones. This can be quite a simple job or a bit tricky depending on the shape of the hull and how corroded the old steering is. It is definitely something you can do yourself though using only simple hand tools. Each cable type has a different licking mechanism, either an R clip or a strew that how the spiral section in the helm."
vzT-XY3i30A,Fixing a hole in an aluminium boat without welding,Public,"In this video I repair a couple of holes in the transom of an aluminium boat using Sikaflex, an aluminium patch and some rivets. This technique is great if you don't have the option to TIG weld a plate onto the boat.

There are ways of making it even more water tight than shown here: you can put a patch on both sides of the hole and you can coat one or both sides in an epoxy paint. 

Be sure to give the Sikaflex plenty of time to dry before either painting or putting the boat back in the water!"
d4M3IXdrN4k,Raising a radar reflector up a back stay,Public,In this video I use the main halyard to raise a radar reflector up the back stay. This relies on attaching the halyard with a slip knot that can be released from the deck without climbing up. Filmed on location in Monemvasia!
nDWqZe8cvI0,Locking an outboard to a boat,Public,"In this video I show a quick tip on how I use a padlock to secure and outboard to the transom of a boat. For additional security you can also chain an outboard to a cross member in the hull, but this method is simple and quick and provides reasonable protection against theft and loss through the clamps vibrating lose."
RkQU05WhNZk,What's inside an outboard motor?,Public,"In this video I pull a Honda 10HP four stroke outboard to pieces to show all the parts inside. This video is a complete teardown of an outboard showing the gearbox, middle section, steering bracket, powerhead, and controls. If you've ever wanted to know what's inside an outboard this is the dissection video for you!"
HRpfaOiXxWo,Replacing leaking prop shaft oil seals on an outboard motor,Public,"When the gearbox oil on an outboard either leaks out entirely or gets emulsified, it is generally because on or more of the oil seals have failed. In this case it is the oil seals around the prop shaft of a Yamaha outboard have been damaged by fishing line.

This video covers removing the bearing carrier from the gearbox, removing the oil seals and then installing the new ones. The final step before putting new oil back in the gearbox is to pressure test the gearbox to make sure the fix has worked."
hYPuB9nmS8E,How an outboard gearbox works,Public,"In this video we look at the inner workings of an outboard motor's gearbox. This includes the drive shaft, shift linkage, dog clutch, forward and reverse gears and the prop shaft. You'll see how the dog clutch moves to select forward, neutral and reverse as well as where the exhaust gases flows out behind the propellor."
YAnO9_GiZxw,Sea charts for coastal navigation,Public,"This video is a basic introduction to sea charts. We will go through how to read depths and bridge heights, plot magnetic and true courses from the compass rose using a parallel ruler and how to measure distance in nautical miles. In particular detail is information on converting from magnetic to true and from true to magnetic. This is on of the fundamental skills required for coastal navigation."
svFJeG6BqLo,Beginner's guide to launching a trailer boat,Public,"In this video I look at the very basics of launching and retrieving a boat trailer. This includes hooking it up to the car, putting the boat on, getting it ready to tow, what to look for on the road and also how to put the boat into the water. We also look at a bit of boat ramp etiquette."
woVT4czk6ao,Fixing the trim tilt on an outboard motor,Public,In this video I diagnose and fix and outboard trim tilt mechanism. This  boat turns out to have a faulty electric motor which is fixed by cleaning the armature and brushes. The commutator bars were not making good contact with the brushes due to the brushes being too gummed up for the springs to push them forward. This video also goes through testing the trim tilt relay as well as the activation switch.
nil7mx3x63k,Diagnosing an outboard that won't start,Public,"In this video I show the way I approach and outboard that is turning over (cranking) but not starting.

B4acSf_BgP4,Fixing an outboard that won't go into gear,Public,"In this video diagnose and repair an outboard that won't go into gear. In particular, this outboard won't go into reverse and after adjusting the gear selection cables without success, it turns out that the dog clutch is worn and needs machining."
Vt8aRamdac4,Adding a starter motor to an outboard motor,Public,"In this video I install a starter motor into an outboard that was previously pull-start only. This involves wiring a starter relay/ solenoid and finding the correct wire from the forward control key switch to activate the relay. There is also short demonstration on how to ""hot wire"" and outboard motor. Please use this technique with extreme caution as both high current and sparks around fuel vapours can be very dangerous.

Outboards can become frozen if left sitting for while but with lubrication and careful movement that can be brought back to life. Rust and corrosion are the biggest causes of an outboard seizing, but they can also seize from overheating, running out of oil or gearbox troubles. This video covered seizing caused by water in the fuel causing the pistons and rings to fuse to the inside of the cylinder bores.

HBwbhepaCAc,Fixing an outboard speedometer,Public,"Most outboard speedometers stop working because the pitot tube in the gearbox gets blocked up with debris. It is a simple process of unblocking this tube with a drill bit to get the speedo working again. This is the same for almost all brands of outboard motors even though in this one we use a Yamaha outboard. The main symptom of this type of blockage is having the speedometer show zero knots (or miles per hour) even though you are travelling at speed.

In this video I go with a group of friends down to Sydney Harbour on an old timber fishing trawler to pickup a smaller 21 timber fishing boat. It turns out to be the perfect weather for a little sea voyage, apart from a bit of smoke around from some hazard reduction burns being conducted up in the mountains.

GTK18LGT9Bw,When to give up on an outboard motor,Public,"This video is about when to give up on an old outboard and just replace it. Eventually an outboard will just be too far gone and fixing it is no longer a good option. In this step of the Green Machine restoration project I remove the old motor from the hull in order to get ready for the new one arriving. Removing an outboard from a boat involves removing the wiring loom, the control cables, the steering cable and the four bolts that secure it to the transom. I then use a standard engine crane to lift it off the back of the boat and put it onto a wooden outboard stand.

vO1iYyqsUEg,Testing a rectifier,Public,"This video is on the techniques for testing a bridge rectifier. 

*** UPDATE ***

I emailed a good friend of mine, Luc Small ( Check out his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/lucsmallau ) and he had the following to say:

""I think you are on the right track in thinking the regulator component is messing up your test.

You see, when I saw your blackboard charging circuit I wondered what was limiting the charge current applied to the battery. In the simplest case a resistor is placed in series with the battery to limit the charge current.

But from what I can see the regulator inside the rectifier unit takes the different approach of shunting excess current away from the battery. If you take a look at the first circuit diagram on this page, you’ll see the bridge rectifier and then to the right the shunt regulator using 3 SCRs - silicon controlled rectifiers - which look like diodes with an extra connection:

https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/235195/3-phase-permanent-magnet-alternator-with-regulator-rectifier-scr-output-wavefo

(Note this is for a 3 phase system so the bridge uses 6 diodes and the shunt 3 SCRs).

So my guess is that you have a shunt regulator in your unit. It contains an SCR. When you measure from the green to black terminal and get 0.99v, I think you are measuring the voltage drop across the SCR. Ie you are making it behave like a diode.

According to Wikipedia “The device [SCR] behaves as 2 diodes are connected in series with reverse voltage applied.”. That would explain why you are seeing a voltage drop of about 1v, double that of the 0.5v your other diodes are dropping.

I suspect your smaller device is a pure bridge without a built in regulator.""

Finally while cutting the rubbing strip from the chine diesel begins to run out of the hull. I then quickly drain that tank, open the inspection hatch and clean out the tank ready for welding.

Next step is to add some Chlor-Rid (http://www.chlor-rid.com/) into the water to help with rust issues once the steel has been blasted. Hold-Blast can also be used afterwards if the steel won't be primed for a day or two.

HTBA9itc1EI,Some questions answered,Public,"In this video I answer some of questions commonly asked by viewers.

BIO (Really need to get a website working...)

Most of my early career was spent in IT. Initially in Mainframe operations (where I met my wife Vicki 28 years ago) and then moving on to TCP/IP and Ethernet networking. After that, a bit of time working as an Unix system administrator and after that a C and Java developer. During this period I loved playing all the old Infocom games so I also developed my own interpreted programming language JACL for creating Interactive Fiction (https://sourceforge.net/p/jacl/wiki/Home/) 

Around this time my friend Paul and I did our Open Water and Advanced SCUBA diving tickets with PADI and began our fascination with exploring the underwater world.

I moved to Dangar Island in 1999 which made boating a part of daily life. We moved to the island because it was cheap to buy and it is cheap because there is no way on or off the island without getting in a boat. Commuter boats get a hard life living on the water so keeping them running became a necessity.

After building a couple of houses on the island (including my own) I went on to work as a deckhand on Sydney Harbour to get my hours up to get my Coxswain ticket. After completing the Coxswain course at Newcastle TAFE I started working as a Boating Service Officer (BSO) for NSW Maritime, our local waterways authority. I filled this role on Port Hacking, Botany Bay, Sydney Harbour and the Hawkesbury river for five years. As a BSO you do on-water patrols for both compliance and investigate boat accidents. I’d like to go through some of my old accident investigations as videos a bit like Air Crash Investigation for boats.

Next I worked as an eResearch Analyst for Intersect, a not-for-profit IT Company that provided bespoke IT solutions for university researchers in NSW. This involved working with a variety of research disciplines such as Medicine, Environment and Astronomy. 

It was during my years working at Intersect I started making the YouTube videos after enjoying Eric the Car Guy’s videos.

I left Intersect to open a mechanical workshop with my friend Arn where we serviced cars, bikes and the occasional boat for friends. During this time I finished a mechanical apprenticeship in order to become a licensed Light Vehicle Mechanic. 

When I purchased a steel trawler to restore, Arn and I rented our workshop out to another mechanic to run his own business and for the first time I began running the YouTube channel full time.

My future plans for the channel are to use the trawler to explore the shipwrecks that scatter the Australian coastline. These videos will cover cruising to the locations, researching and diving on the wrecks and maintaining the boat and equipment was we go.

aKMnLa2_RtU,Cleaning and repairing a boat heat exchanger,Public,"Boat heat exchangers are similar to car radiators, only raw water from the river, lake or ocean you are boating in is used to cool the coolant pumped through the engine instead of air. With the exception of keel cooling, this raw water will cause corrosion and blockages in the small tubes that coolant passes over which means that they require regular maintenance to keep them working properly. In Pete's Halvorsen 36 the heat exchanges are in serious need of replacing, but we have a go at cleaning and repairing them to get one last season out of them. This involves removing the heat exchangers, giving them a quick soak in acid, using some Devcon F epoxy putty to repair the housing and then sanding and painting.

Epoxy putty used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00065TNAW/?ref=exp_dangarmarine_dp_vv_d

n7vxiTHwVx8,Gone fishing!,Public,"Fishing at last! In this video I head out fishing with Adrian (God's gift to Detroit Diesel owners!) and his stepson Thomas and Jason from Remora Lures Australia ( https://www.facebook.com/remoralures )

On the first trip the boys catch a few flathead, which they kindly let me keep, and then on the second day Jason helps me to install some rod holders on Renko and teaches me the basics of game fishing for tuna and marlin. To make the day extra special he also gave me a custom Renko lure to get me started. :)

KgA9n44lZ_0,Solo SCUBA Diving,Public,"In this video I share some of my experiences going through the SDI Solo Diver course with John from Frog Dive. As well as some new theory to learn about calculating air consumption, this course involved becoming familiar with using a pony bottle as a fully redundant air supply and lauching a Surface Marker Buoy from the bottom using a reel. I also carried a spare mask which I ended up needing!

The training dives for the his course were conducted on the wreck of the HMAS Adeldaide leaving out of Terrigal by boat. The HMAS Adelaide is a 138 metre decommisioned frigate that was scuttled in 2011.

adThi_8r4Lk,Diagnosing the Detroit Diesel 471,Public,"In this video Adrian and I teardown the Detroit Diesel from Renko to find the source of the oil leak, which ends up to be leaking wrist pin / gudgeon pin seals. While the engine is out we also add an air compressor along with several other improvements to make the most of the opportunity.

This particular leak allows oil to flow up through the conrods, along the wrist pins then out the sides of the piston. It then travels through the liner ports and into the airbox which should only have fresh air and exhaust in it. The oil will then leak out through the airbox drains into the catch can and/ or out the exhaust pipe.

9CRFgZGvNLY,"Detroit Diesel injectors, cam rollers and oil pump pressure regulator",Public,"In this video Adrian cleans up the camshaft / pushrod rollers and shows me how to install and adjust them. After that we replace the regulator springs in the oil pump to bring the oil pressure back up. Low oil pressure in a Detroit Diesel can be caused by these springs getting too weak and releasing oil pressure early. We also found a second-hand deep-belly sump pan so we have started measuing things up to modify the oil pump pickup. The deep oil pan is important to have in a boat due to the angle the engine sits on (9 degrees) and the rolling of the boat at sea. 

After than Adrian shows us all the parts of a Detroit Diesel unit injector and how they work. He then pressure tests and test fires a complete injector using the factory tool and tests an injector tip using a tool he made himself from the ejector seat handle from a Harrier Jump Jet. Gotta love this guy. :)

We also press new little end bearings into the conrods and send them off to be machined to match the gudgeon / wrist pin. 

Finally we clean up an old emergency shutoff flap that I was given my a friend Andrew and get it ready to go on the boat.

Lots of other little jobs happen this week too such as brazing a much more compact raw water pipe system, making a new washer plate for the forward port engine mount and adding o-rings to the anodes to stop them vibrating lose etc, etc...

prcdH2NOCXE,Assembling the Detroit Diesel,Public,"The Detroit Diesel 471 rebuild continues! In this video Adrian and I reinstall the oil pump then shim it to get the correct gear clearance / backlash. Adrian also makes up a new oil pickup to match the new deep pan sump.

After that we put the conrods and gudgeon pins into the pistons and install the piston pin retainers using a tool that doesn't look like a golf ball. Once all the piston pin retainers have passed a vacuum test the oil and compression rings go onto the pistons then the pistons get installed into the bottom end of the cylinder liners. The loaded liners then get installed into the block.

Last up we install the cylinder head back onto the block.
