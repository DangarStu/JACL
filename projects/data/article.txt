The order tasks and test are done is worth writing down. For example, you can 
clean a carburettor, put it back on the engine to see if the problem has gone 
away, and find it hasn't. You then put a new fuel hose in but it still doesn't 
run. It could be that the old fuel hose blocked the carburettor again on the 
first test start and therefore needs cleaning again now the new hose is in. 
From the video it sounds a bit like the idle circuit isn't working in the 
carburettor. In this case both tasks required to fix this outboard were done,
just in the wrong order therefore requiring the first to be done again.
