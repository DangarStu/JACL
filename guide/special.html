<h1><a class="title" name="special0">Special-Purpose Commands</a></h1>

<h2><a class="section" name="special1">The POINTS Command</a></h2> 

<P>The <b>points</b> command is used to award points to the player and must be followed by a single integer indicating the number of points to be awarded. The awarded points will be added to the integer variable <b>score</b>. Below are two examples of the <b>points</b> command being used:

<pre>
points 10
points gold(points)
</pre>

<P>When the <b>points</b> command is used the following message will be displayed to the player:

<pre>
[YOUR SCORE JUST WENT UP BY <i>n</i> POINTS]
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="special2">The PROXY Command</a></h2> 

<P>The <b>proxy</b> command is used to issue an in-game move as though it was typed by the player and must be of the following syntax:

<pre>
<b>proxy</b> <I>Move</I>
</pre>

<p>The specified <I>Move</I> may consist of multiple parameters, built up from plain text, variables, constants or macros. When the move is issued by the <b>proxy</b> command, all the normal testing will take place and all usual messages will be displayed. The most common use for the <b>proxy</b> command is to translate one command into another similar command. For example, sometimes two different commands can be mapped to the same function:

<pre>
grammar put *held in *here     &gt;insert
grammar insert *held in *here  &gt;insert
</pre>

<P>With the above two <b>grammar</b> statements only the verb is different so mapping them to the same function is possible. In some situations, however, this is not possible as the nouns appear in a different order. Below is an example of how the <b>proxy</b> command can save the day:

<pre>
grammar look at *here through *held &gt;look_at_through

{+look_at_through

;main function code tied to this syntax

}

grammar look through *held at *here &gt;look_through_at

{+look_through_at
proxy "look at " noun2{names} " through " noun1{names} ; This will cause
                                                       ; the alternate
                                                       ; syntax to be used
}
</pre>

<p>When the second syntax is used by the player, the only action is to execute a a <b>proxy</b> command. This issues a command on the player's behalf that matches the first syntax, therefore arriving at the main function with <b>noun1</b> and <b>noun2</b> pointing to the correct objects.

<p>The macro <b>{names}</b> is almost exclusively used with the <b>proxy</b> command and outputs all of the names of the object separated by spaces. For example, the following code will issue the command "set safe dial to 42":

<pre>
object dial : safe dial
 short		the "safe dial"

{set
execute +build_command&lt;this&lt;42
}

{+issue_set
proxy "set " arg[0]{names} " to " arg[1]
}
</pre>

</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="special3">Trigonometry</a></h2> 

<p>JACL provides a set of trigonometric commands to help model a two dimensional space. Each object in JACL has the integer elements <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>bearing</b> and <b>velocity</b>. The values of these elements are read and updated by the following three commands.

<h2><a class="section" name="special4">The POSITION Command</a></h2> 

<p>The <b>position</b> command is used to change an object's <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> elements to simulate it moving on a two-dimensional grid. The movement that occurs depends on the current values for the object's <b>bearing</b> and <b>velocity</b>. A <b>position</b> command is simply followed by the label of the object to be moved:

<pre>
set ship_object(bearing) = 180
set ship_object(velocity) = 100
set ship_object(x) = 500
set ship_object(y) = 500

position ship_object
</pre>

<p>The above code will set <b>ship_object(x)</b> to equal 500 and <b>ship_object(y)</b> to equal 400.

<h2><a class="section" name="special5">The BEARING Command</a></h2> 

<p>The <b>bearing</b> command is used to calculate the angle from one object to another based on their current <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> values. A <b>bearing</b> command is followed by a variable to store the calculated angle in, the object to measure the angle from, then the object to measure the angle to. For example:

<pre>
bearing INDEX lighthouse ship
write "Bearing from " lighthouse{the} " to " 
write ship{the} ": " INDEX " degrees.^"
</pre>

<p>The above code calculates the bearing from the object <b>lighthouse</b> to the object <b>ship</b> in degrees (0 - 359), and stores the result in the variable <b>INDEX</b>. This calculation is based on the current values of <b>lighthouse(x)</b> and <b>lighthouse(y)</b> relative to the current values of <b>ship(x)</b> and <b>ship(y)</b>. 

<h2><a class="section" name="special6">The DISTANCE Command</a></h2> 

<p>The <b>distance</b> command is used to calculate the distance between two objects based on their current <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> values. A <b>distance</b> command works in the same manner as a <b>bearing</b> command:

<pre>
distance INDEX lighthouse ship
write "Distance from " lighthouse{the} " to " 
write ship{the} ": " INDEX ^
</pre>

<p>The above code calculates the distance between the object <b>lighthouse</b> and the object <b>ship</b> and stores the result in the variable <b>INDEX</b>. This calculation is based on the current values of <b>lighthouse(x)</b> and <b>lighthouse(y)</b> relative to the current values of <b>ship(x)</b> and <b>ship(y)</b>. 

<h2><a class="section" name="special7">The ASKNUMBER AND GETNUMBER Commands</a></h2> 
<p>The commands <b>asknumber</b> and <b>getnumber</b> prompt the player to input a number between a particular range and wait for a response. The only difference between the two commands is that <b>getnumber</b> will continue to ask the player for a valid response, only returning when a number between the upper and lower limit is entered. Both of these commands use the following syntax:
<pre>
<b>asknumber</b> <i>StorageVariable LowerLimit UpperLimit</i>
</pre>

<p><i>StorageVariable</i> is the integer variable used to store the number entered by the player. <i>LowerLimit</i> and <i>UpperLimit</i> indicate the inclusive range of numbers that are acceptable. For example, below is some code that prompts the player to enter a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive), and stores the answer in a variable called <b>RESPONSE</b>:

<pre>
integer RESPONSE
integer UPPER       5

{+ask_player
...
asknumber RESPONSE 1 UPPER
write &quot;You typed &quot; RESPONSE .^
}
</pre>

<p>When using the <b>asknumber</b> command, if the player enters an invalid response, <b>-1</b> will be placed in the storage variable and the next line of code will be executed.

<h2><a class="section" name="special8">The GETSTRING Command</a></h2> 

<p>The command <b>getstring</b> will prompt the player to enter an arbitrary string of text. The only parameter of a <b>getstring</b> is the name of the string variable to store the player's response. Below is an example of the use of the <b>getstring</b> command:

<pre>
string players_name

{+intro
write "What is your name? "
getstring players_name
write "Hello " players_name "!^"
}
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="special9">The GETYESORNO Command</a></h2> 

<p>The command <b>getyesorno</b> will prompt the player to enter <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>. It will repeatedly prompt the player to enter a valid response until they do so. The only parameter of a <b>getyesorno</b> command is the integer variable used to store the player's response. If the player types <b>yes</b> (or <b>y</b>), the variable will contain the number 1. If the player types <b>no</b> (or <b>n</b>), the variable will contain the number 0. Below is an example of the <b>getyesorno</b> command in action:

<pre>
constant hints		5

{+ask_player
write &quot;Would you like hints?^&quot;
getyesorno player(hints)
if player(hints) =  1
   write &quot;You typed yes.^&quot;
else
   write &quot;You typed no.^&quot;
endif
}
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="special10">The SAVEGAME and RESTOREGAME Commands</a></h2> 

<p>These commands can be used to access the internal functionality to save and restore the current game state. Both of these commands require a container to be passed as a parameter. This container is used to store the return code of the command. If the save or restore operation fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed and the supplied container will be set to <b>false</b>. If the save or restore operation is successful, the supplied container will be set to <b>true</b> and no message will be displayed. Both commands accept an optional second parameter that is a string to use as the filename. If this parameter is not supplied the Glk library will prompt the player to select a file. A common use of these commands is to define the functions <b>+save_game</b> and <b>+restore_game</b> to override the internal implementation of this functionality. For example:

<pre>
variable ANSWER
variable RETURN_CODE

{+restore_game
write &quot;Are you sure you wish to restore a saved game?^&quot;
getyesorno ANSWER
if ANSWER = 0
   write &quot;Returning to game.^&quot;
   return
endif
restoregame RETURN_CODE
if RETURN_CODE = true
   print:
      &quot;You cast the spell of time travel and return to the past...^&quot;
   .
endif
}
</pre>

<p>The ability to supply a filename can be used to either allow the player to supply the filename directly after the save command, or implement a system of auto-saving every tenth move such as this:

<pre>
{+eachturn
set save_timer = total_moves
set save_timer % 10
if save_timer = 0
   set save_count + 1
   setstring filename "autosave"
   addstring filename save_count
   addstring filename ".sav"
   savegame RETURN_CODE filename
endif
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="special12">The TERMINATE Command</a></h2> 

<p>The <b>terminate</b> command will directly initiate the termination of the JACL interpreter.

<h2><a class="section" name="special13">The UNDOMOVE Command</a></h2> 

<p>The <b>undomove</b> command will take the game back to the state it was in prior to the player's last command.
