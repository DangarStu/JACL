<h1><a class="title" name="webinterface0">GUI Web Interface</a></h1>

<p>A set of library files are included with JACL to assist in the creation of a more visually pleasing and flexible web interface for your games. These libraries display an interface that operates in one of three modes. The first is the Ajax mode which is functionally equivalent to the default header and footer with the addition of control over colours and images and hyperlinked exits. The second is the Standard mode which does not use Ajax for the command submission and includes a compass rose in the footer. The third is the GUI mode which displays two list boxes, one for the objects being carried and one for the objects in the current location; a compass rose for moving around; and a set of action buttons that represent some of the common verbs. When this interface is used, a text command is constructed and processed by the interpreter as normal. The player is given the choice of swapping between these three modes.

<p>Below is a screen shot of the web interface running in GUI mode:

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png"></td>
<td>If you wish your game to be playable using this point-and-click interface you must be careful to design it to be solveable using only the verbs available.</td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="webinterface1">Using the Interface</a></h2>

<p>To use this web interface you first need to include the appropriate library at the bottom of your game file with the line:

<pre>
#include "webinterface.library"
</pre>

<p>Once this library is included, certain string constants must be defined to provide information that is specific to your game. Here are the values from The Down Dragon, as show in the screenshot above:

<pre>
constant title_image "/images/dragon.png"
constant footer_image "none"
constant header_colour "#42596d"
constant linkbar_colour "#3f3527"
constant maintext_colour "#dddddd"
</pre>

<p>The value for <b>title_image</b> specifies which image to display in the top title bar. This image must be 85 pixels high and may be of any width. As browsers can be resized by the player, best results are achieved by having the right-hand edge of the image blend well with the background colour specified in <b>header_colour</b>. Note that this is also the colour used for the footer of the page. If <b>image_title</b> is set to <b>none</b>, the value of <b>game_title</b> is displayed instead.

<p>Like the header it is also possible to choose an image to be displayed in the footer of the page. This image is displayed in the background behind the user interface itself. This image is set to repeat both horizontally and vertically.

<p>The value for <b>main_text</b> configures the background colour of the main window that contains the game's text output.

<p>Colours can be specified in any format acceptable to the HTML specification. For example, it is also valid to supply a plain text colour such as <b>blue</b>. The colours above are specified as hexadecimal RGB values to provided more fine-grained control over the exact shade of the colour.
