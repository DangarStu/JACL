<h1><a class="title" name="playing0">Playing Interactive Fiction</a></h1>

<p>Interactive fiction involves the reader in a way that static stories 
do not. Rather than reading sequentially from beginning to end, you 
control the actions of the main character by typing commands in the 
form of simple English sentences. Before setting out on your adventure 
there are a few concepts that must be explained in order for you to 
interact successfully with the virtual world created by the author.

<h2><a class="section" name="playing1">Moving Around</a></h2>

<p>The physical space that you will be exploring is divided up into 
discrete units called locations. Locations may be travelled between 
using the following commands:</p>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=40%>
<TR><TH>Command</TH><TH>Direction</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><b>n</b></TD><TD>North</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>s</b></TD><TD>South</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>e</b></TD><TD>East</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>w</b></TD><TD>West</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>ne</b></TD><TD>Northeast</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>nw</b></TD><TD>Northwest</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>se</b></TD><TD>Southeast</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>sw</b></TD><TD>Southwest</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>u</b></TD><TD>Up</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>d</b></TD><TD>Down</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>in</b></TD><TD>In</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>out</b></TD><TD>Out</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<p>The description of each location will tell you the directions in which you can travel from it. Be aware, however, that some exits may only be available under certain circumstances such as while a door is open or a bridge lowered.</p>

<h2><a class="section" name="playing2">Manipulating Objects</a></h2>

<p>Within these locations you will find many objects that you can 
interact with. These objects may be referred to by as few 
or as many of their names as is required to uniquely identify it.
For example, if the story informs you that "There is a silver key 
resting here." Then it may be referred to as either <b>silver</b>, <b>key</b> or 
<b>silver key</b>. If your reference is ambiguous, such as using <b>key</b> 
when there is both a silver and a gold key in the current location 
then you will be prompted to be more specific.</p>

<p>The next thing to learn about interactive fiction is the 
way in which you interact with these objects.

<!-- NEW PAGE -->
<p>The basic sentence structures understood by the game are:
<center><table width=50%><tr>
<th>Command Structure</th><th>Example command</th>
</tr><tr>
<TD><i>action</i></TD><TD><b>scream</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><i>action object</i></TD><TD><b>take book</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><i>action object preposition object</i></TD><TD><b>unlock door with key</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
</table></center>
<p>An action does not necessarily have to be a single word. For instance, 
"examine rock through magnifying glass", an example of the last 
syntax, may also be expressed as "look at rock through magnifying 
glass". Following is a list of some of the other actions that can be used to interact with the objects you find:

<center><table width=80%><tr>
<TD><b>turn</b></TD><TD><b>read</b></TD><TD><b>pull</b></TD><TD><b>push</b></TD><TD><b>eat</b></TD><TD><b>cut</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><b>lock</b></TD><TD><b>unlock</b></TD><TD><b>rub</b></TD><TD><b>attack</b></TD><TD><b>taste</b></TD><TD><b>drink</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><b>break</b></TD><TD><b>smell</b></TD><TD><b>listen</b></TD><TD><b>pour</b></TD><TD><b>move</b></TD><TD><b>light</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><b>play</b></TD><TD><b>blow</b></TD><TD><b>throw</b></TD><TD><b>wear</b></TD><TD><b>open</b></TD><TD><b>close</b></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><b>take</b></TD><TD><b>drop</b></TD><TD><b>insert</b></TD><TD><b>remove</b></TD>
</tr></table></center>

<p>Where an object is expected, the words <b>it</b>, <b>them</b>, <b>him</b> and <b>her</b> can be used to indicate the last appropriate object referred to in one of your commands. With some commands it is possible to supply more than one object. Multiple objects can be specified in a multitude of ways. The words <b>all</b> or <b>everything</b> will tell the interpreter that you wish to perform the action on all the objects in the appropriate scope. For example, with the command <b>drop all</b>, the interpreter will perform the <b>drop</b> action for every object you are currently carrying.

<p>Any object reference can be qualified by using the word <b>from</b>. Although this can be used at any time, it is most useful in conjunction with <b>all</b> to construct commands such as <b>take all from chest</b>. This command will perform the <b>take</b> action for every object that is currrently inside the chest. 

<p>The word <b>except</b> can be used once per list of objects, with any object to the right of the word <b>except</b> being removed from list of objects to the left. An example of this is the command <b>take all from chest except the gem</b>. The important thing to be aware of with the word <b>except</b> is that any objects supplied after the word <b>except</b> are objects the action is not to be performed on. With this in mind you can see how the two commands below have very different results.

<pre>
&gt;take sword and all from chest except gem
&gt;take all from chest except gem and sword
</pre>

<p>With the first command the sword will be taken, with the second command it will not. So in summary, any list of objects may use the word <b>from</b> many times, but <b>except</b> only once at most. Individual objects can be separated by the word <b>and</b> or a comma (<b>,</b>) while the word <b>then</b> or a period (<b>.</b>) is used to separate completely different commands. Below is a legal command that uses all of the forementioned functionality:

<pre>
&gt;take sword, shield, all from chest and all from shelf except gem then go north
</pre>

<p>When playing interactive fiction, it is important to have a general feeling for how much can be achieved with a single command. A task such as defusing a bomb would generally not be performed by typing <B>defuse bomb</B>. The following is a sample transcript to give you a better feel for how a task such as this might be achieved:</p>

<pre>
&gt;examine bomb
The bomb is about a foot square and has a small panel in its upper 
surface. The panel is currently closed.
 
&gt;listen to bomb
The bomb is making an ominous ticking sound.

&gt;open panel
You open the panel to reveal a red wire, a green wire, a blue wire, 
a clock and some dynamite.

&gt;i
You are carrying a bomb manual, an insurance policy and some wire 
cutters.

&gt;read manual
Leafing through the book you come to the page on diffusing. Seems 
straight forward enough, just cut the blue wire then the red one.

&gt;cut blue wire with cutters
Reaching carefully in to the bomb's casing you cut the blue wire. So 
far so good.

&gt;cut red wire with cutters
Holding your breath you snip the red wire.

&gt;listen to bomb
The bomb, thankfully, is now silent.
</pre>

<p>As you can see, each task you wish to achieve must be broken down 
into its component actions.</p>

<h2><a class="section" name="playing3">Interacting with Characters</a></h2>

<p>During the course of the story you may encounter other computer 
controlled characters. These characters may be interacted with using 
the following commands:

<table noboder><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>talk to</b> <i>character</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>give</b> <i>object</i> <b>to</b> <i>character</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>show</b> <i>object</i> <b>to</b> <i>character</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>ask</b> <i>character</i> <b>for</b> <i>object</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>ask</b> <i>character</i> <b>about</b> <i>object</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>tell</b> <i>character</i> <b>about</b> <i>object</i></td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="playing4">Meta Commands</a></h2>

<p>There are also some special commands for interacting with the JACL interpreter 
rather than the game world it is currently running:</p>

</TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<p>You are now ready to embark on your first adventure into the 
world of interactive fiction.
 Remember to make a map as you go and read everything 
carefully as vital clues may be hidden in the descriptions of the 
locations and objects you come across. Examining every object you can 
refer to is a good idea, as is saving your position often. Well, good 
luck, and above all have fun!
