<h1><a class="title" name="http0">HTTP and HTML</a></h1>

<p>This chapter covers the aspects of HTML and HTTP that relate to writing games for use with the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreters, including the JACL commands that assist with the output of HTML. If you are not familiar with HTML, it is highly recommended that you read at least a basic tutorial before starting to write your first web-based game.  

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png"></td>
<td>The <b>jacl</b> interpreter will consider all the HTML-specific commands as errors so it is important to either test the value of constant <b>interpreter</b> (either <b>GLK</b> or <b>CGI</b>) to be sure the game is being played with a web version of JACL or use these commands from a function like <b>+header</b> or <b>+footer</b> that is only executed by the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreter.</td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="http1">Document Structure</a></h2>

<p>A complete HTML page must be returned by your game in response to each of the player's moves. To assist with this, if you do not define your own custom header and footer functions (<b>+header</b> and <b>+footer</b>), the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreter will insert template headers and footers to mimick a standard interactive fiction interface. If a <b>+header</b> function is supplied, it is the very first thing to be executed. The default header looks like this:

<pre> 
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt; 
 
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; 
   &lt;title&gt;game_title&lt;/title&gt; 
   &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt; 
   &lt;!--
   function userCommand() {
      var xhReq = createXMLHttpRequest();
      if(xhReq == null) { return true; }
      var user_id = document.JACLGameForm.user_id.value;
      var command = document.JACLGameForm.command.value;
      xhReq.open("GET", "?user_id="+user_id+"&amp;command="+command+"&amp;ajax=true", false);
      xhReq.send(null);
      var serverResponse = xhReq.responseText;
      var maintext = document.getElementById("maintext");
      maintext.innerHTML += "&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&gt;" + command + "&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;" + serverResponse;
      maintext.scrollTop = maintext.scrollHeight;
      document.JACLGameForm.command.value = "";
      return false; }
    function putFocus(formInst, elementInst) {
      if (document.forms.length &gt; 0) {
          document.forms[formInst].elements[elementInst].focus(); }}
    function createXMLHttpRequest() {
       try { return new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
       try { return new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); } catch (e) {}
       return null; }
    --&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt; 
    &lt;style&gt; &lt;!--
       #footer { 
           position:absolute;
           bottom:0;
           left:0;
           right:0;
           display:block;
           font-family: Verdana, Arial, Sanserif;
           padding-top: 10px;
           padding-bottom: 10px;
           padding-left: 20px;
           background: #dddddd; }
       #main {
           position:absolute;
           margin-left:10;
           margin-right:10;
           left:0;
           top:0px;
           right:0;
           overflow:auto; }
       div.maintext {
            font-family: Verdana, Arial, Sanserif;
            padding-top: 20px;
            padding-bottom: 20px;
            padding-left: 50px;
            padding-right: 50px;
            font-size: 12px;
            overflow: auto; }
    --&gt; &lt;/style&gt; 
    &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body onLoad="putFocus(0, 0);"&gt; 
    &lt;div id="main"&gt; 
    &lt;div id="maintext" class="maintext"&gt; 
</pre>

<p>This header sets the DOCTYPE for the returned HTML document, sets the title of the browser window to the name of the game, provides some Javascript functions to set the input focus to the command prompt and make the Ajax call to the server when a command is entered. It also outputs the CSS styles required and opens a DIV for the game's output to appear in.

<p>The body of the <b>maintext</b> DIV is then produced by your game.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png"></td>
<td>If you do provide your own custom <b>+header</b> function, be aware that you can't display values that are modified by the player's command. This is because a full page is generated in order, top to bottom. For example, if the header was to display the title of the current location, when the player moved the header would be displayed and would show the current location. The movement command would then be processed to move the player and then the footer displayed. As you can see, this would result in the header showing the location the player was in <i>before</i> the command took place. The footer does not have this limitation.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>The function <b>+footer</b> is the very last function to be executed after a player's move has been processed. If one is not supplied the following default output is inserted by the interpreter:

<pre>
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div id="footer" class="footer"&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;input type=text style='border-style:none;' size=60 name="command"&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
      &lt;input type=hidden name="user_id" value="xxxxxx-xxx"&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/form&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; 
</pre>

<p>There are two significant aspects to this footer. The first is that it contains the input field where the player will type their commands. This input field must have the name <b>command</b> as this is where the interpreter will looks for the player's command when the form is submitted. The second is the hidden input that contains the <b>user_id</b> for the player. 

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png"></td>
<td>An alternative to using the header and footer built into interpreter or coding your own from scratch is to use the <a href="webinterface.html#webinterface0">webinterface.library</a>.</td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="http2">Linebreaks</a></h2>

<p>In order to avoid the need to fill a standard interactive fiction game or the standard library with HTML tags the caret newline character (<b>^</b>) is output by the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreters as <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> followed by a newline. This behaviour can be turned off by setting the JACL variable <b>linebreaks</b> to <b>false</b>. This is usually desireable in section such as the header and footer where code is only executed by the web-based interpreters and can therefore contain any amount of custom HTML you require.

<h2><a class="section" name="http3">The Player's User ID</a></h2>

<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that each request received by the web server is completely independent of any that came before it. The <b>cgijacl</b> interpreters, however, need to know which player each request has come from, and more specificly, what state the game world was in at the end of their previous move. For this reason, a unique user ID must be sent with each of the player's commands. Failure to do so at any time will result in the game restarting from the beginning and a new user ID being assigned automatically.

<p>To propogate the player's user ID, it must be passed as the HTML parameter <b>user_id</b>. This is done by including it as a hidden field in any forms, or as a URL parameter in any hyperlinks. The token <b>$user_id</b> maybe be used in any <b>write</b> statement to output the automatically generated ID. Below are two examples of its use:

<pre>
write "&lt;a href=~" $url "?user_id=" $user_id 
write "&amp;command=look~&gt;Look&lt;/a&gt;"
    
write "&lt;input type=~hidden~ name=~user_id~ "
write "value=~" $user_id "~&gt;"
</pre>

<p>In the first set of <b>write</b> statements, the token <b>$user_id</b> is added directly to the end of the URL being linked to as the value of the HTTP parameter <b>user_id</b>. Also used is the token <b>$url</b>. This token displays the URL of the game, such as <b>/fastcgi-bin/game.jacl</b>.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png"></td>
<td>When playing games with the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreter, there is no URL to the game. It is wise, however, to always construct links using the <b>$url</b> token so your game will also work when played with the <b>fcgijacl</b> interpreter.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>The second set of <b>write</b> statements output a hidden form field. This field should be used as part of an HTML form when the player issues their commands by submitting this form.

<p>When using an HTML form, there are two simpler methods of including the player's user ID. The first is the command <b>hidden</b>. This command outputs a line exactly like the <b>input</b> tag above. Below is an example of its use:

<pre>
write "&lt;form&gt;"
write "&lt;input type=~text~ name=~command~&gt;"
hidden ;adds the player's user ID as a hidden form field.
write "&lt;/form&gt;"
</pre>

<p>As you can see, there is nothing difficult about using the <b>hidden</b> command. The second related command is <b>prompt</b>. This command outputs a text input box and the player's user ID. Using <b>prompt</b>, the above code snipet would look like this:

<pre>
write "&lt;form&gt;"
prompt ;adds a text field with the name 'command' and
       ;the player's user ID as a hidden field.
write "&lt;/form&gt;"
</pre>

<p>As you can see, there is even less to using the <b>prompt</b> command.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png"></td>
<td>If you are running a game using the <b>fcgijacl</b> interpreter under a full webserver, the value of the environment variable <b>REMOTE_USER</b> will be used if present instead of creating a randomly generated user ID. This allows a JACL game to be protected by the webserver and the player to receive the same user ID each time they log in and play.</td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="http4">The Player's Commands</a></h2>

<p>The player's commands are passed to the interpreter via three parameters: <b>verb</b>, <b>noun</b> and <b>command</b>. If the parameters <b>verb</b> and <b>noun</b> are passed, <b>noun</b> is concatenated on the end of <b>verb</b> and the result is processed as a single command. This is useful when writing point-and-click adventures that use a combination of list boxes and submit buttons to form verb-noun commands. If the parameter <b>command</b> is passed, it is processed as a complete command. This is useful for traditional text-based adventures.

<p>It is also possible to use both methods of passing the player's moves. When a request is received, the interpreter will first test the value of <b>verb</b>. If this is empty, the value of <b>command</b> is used as the player's move. If <b>verb</b> does contain a value, the value of <b>noun</b> will be concatenated to it, and the move will be processed, ignoring any value that <b>command</b> may or may not have.

<h2><a class="section" name="http5">Ajax Requests</a></h2>

<p>Using standard Javascript techniques (see the default header or <b>webinterface.library</b> for an example), it is possible to request the JACL interpreter to process a command without refreshing the whole browser window. Once the command has been processed Javascript must be used once again to manually insert any output returned into the appropriate HTML element. When performing these types of requests, there are two special URL parameters to be aware of.

<p>The first is the <b>ajax</b> parameter. If this parameter has the value <b>true</b> the header and footer functions will not be called, leaving the interpreter to return only the output produced directly by the command being processed. 

<p>The second is the <b>function</b> parameter. This parameter allows the game author to specify a function to execute as opposed to the usual process of interpreting a command entered by the player. The value of the <b>function</b> parameter is the name of the function to execute. For security purposes, the acceptable values for this parameter are resistricted to a set number of functions: <b>+timer</b>, <b>+ajax</b> and <b>eachturn</b>. The first two options simply call the function of the same name and return any output. The third will call both the global function <b>+eachturn</b> and the eachturn function that is associated with the current location.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png"></td>
<td>The <b>+ajax</b> function serves no predetermined purpose, it is simply a function that can be called by the game author to handle any special-case situations that arise.</td>
</tr></table>
<h2><a class="section" name="http6">The BUTTON Command</a></h2>

<p>The <b>button</b> command is used to create a button that will submit an HTML form. It must be followed by a single parameter that indicates what command this button should issue. Behind the scenes this command creates an <b>input</b> tag of the type <b>submit</b> and sets the value of the HTML parameter <b>verb</b> to the specified command. Below is an example of its use:

<pre>
button Look
button "Read Map"
</pre>

<p>The command specified for each button will appear as text on the button. If a command contains any spaces, the command must be enclosed in double quotes as usual.

<p>It is possible to use a second HTML control, such as a list box, in conjunction with a submit button to create verb-noun commands. See the <b>control</b> command below for more information.
 
<h2><a class="section" name="http7">The HYPERLINK Command</a></h2>

<p>The command <b>hyperlink</b> is a simple method of creating a hyperlink that issues a command for the player. It can accept either two or three parameters.
The first is the visible text to be displayed. The second parameter is the command to be issued when the link is clicked. The third, optional, parameter is the name of a CSS class that should be applied to the link. Below are some sample hyperlinks:

<pre>
hyperlink East east 
hyperlink "Take All" "take+all" small
hyperlink "Where am I?" look big
</pre>

<p>With the third hyperlink, the text <b>Where am I?</b> will appear on the screen with all the styles specified the CSS class <b>big</b> applied. When clicked, it will pass the value <b>look</b> to a parameter named <b>command</b>. This, in effect, issues a <b>look</b> command on the player's behalf.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png"></td>
<td>When using the <b>hyperlink</b> command, any spaces in the third parameter (the command to be executed), must be replaced with plus signs. This is due to the fact that the command is pasted as part of the URL sent to the web browser, and spaces are not valid in a URL.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>When manually creating special-purpose hyperlinks, the <b>{+name}</b> macro is very useful. For more information, see the chapter on <a href="screendisplay.html">Screen Display</a>.

<h2><a class="section" name="http8">The CONTROL Command</a></h2>

<p>The <b>control</b> command is also used to create a hyperlink. With the <b>control</b> command, however, the first parameter is the name of an image to display instead of some plain text. As the <b>control</b> command displays an image, no third parameter indicating a CSS style is allowed. Below is an example of a <b>control</b> command:

<pre>
control "/images/look.png" look 
</pre>

<p>This command will create a hyperlink that issues the command <b>look</b>. The hyperlink will appear on the screen as the image <b>look.png</b>.

<h2><a class="section" name="http9">The OPTION Command</a></h2>

<p>The <b>option</b> command is used to include an object as a part of a <b>&lt;select&gt;</b> list box. A list box allows the user to select one of the objects from the list then submit the form. The selected object is then sent to the server in the form of a name and value pair. This is most useful when the <b>select</b> tag used to create the list box sets the object selected to the parameter <b>noun</b> as the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreters will automatically look for this parameter when constructing a move to process. By default, the <b>option</b> command will set the value returned to all of the specified object's names. The object for each option is specified by following the <b>option</b> command with an object label or pointer. The visible text for the option is the object's short description. For example:

<pre>
&lt;form&gt;
   write "&lt;select name=~noun~&gt;"
   loop
      if noun3 is *present
         option noun3
      endif
   endloop
   write "&lt;/select&gt;"

   button Look
   button Use
   button Take
   button Drop		
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

<p>The above code creates a list box with a parameter name of <b>noun</b> and adds an entry for each object that is in the player's current location. If an object is selected before the form is submitted by clicking one of the four buttons, the parameter <b>noun</b> will have its value set to all the names of the object the player selected and the parameter <b>verb</b> will have its value set to the text on the button that was clicked. These two parameter would then be concatenated (verb + noun) and processed by the interpreter as the player's move.

<p>It is also possible to specify that an <b>option</b> command should pass the object's index as opposed to its names. This is done by following the object pointer or label with the word <b>index</b>. This is only of use if a <b>parameter</b> statement has been defined to accept the parameter name specified in the <b>select</b> tag. Below is an example of this:

<pre>
parameter destination SOME_VARIABLE

&lt;form&gt;
   write "&lt;select name=~destination~&gt;"
   loop
      if noun3 is *present
         option noun3 index
      endif
   endloop
   write "&lt;/select&gt;"
   hidden
   button Jump
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

<p>When this form is submitted, the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreter will look for the parameter <b>destination</b>, as it has been defined using a <b>parameter</b> statement. This parameter will contain the internal number of the object that was selected and this number will be copied into the location specified by the <b>parameter</b> statement. In this case, a variable called <b>SOME_VARIABLE</b>. For more information see the section on <a href="definitions.html#definitions10">parameters</a>.

<h2><a class="section" name="http10">The IMAGE Command</a></h2>

<p>The <b>image</b> command is used to display an image &mdash; no surprise there. It requires three parameters using the following syntax:
	
<pre>
image <i>URL</i> <i>Alignment</i> <i>AlternateText</i>
</pre>

<p>For example:

<pre>
image "/images/view.jpg" left "[View from the balcony]"
</pre>

<p>This command displays the image <b>/images/view.jpg</b> aligned to the left. If the picture is not found, or is displayed in a text-only browser such as Lynx, the text <b>[View from the balcony]</b> will be displayed instead. This is also the text that will be displayed by most graphical browsers when the cursor is held over the image.

<h2><a class="section" name="http11">The Media File</a></h2>

<p>When played with the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreter, each game will require a corresponding <b>.media</b> file in order to serve multi-media content such as images. This file must have the same name as the game, with a <b>.media</b> suffix in place of the <b>.jacl</b> suffix. For example, the game <b>grail.jacl</b> has a matching media file called <b>grail.media</b>. As this game only has one image, its media file only has one line:

<pre>
/grail.jpg image/jpeg images/grail.jpg
</pre>

<p>Each line of a media file has three columns separated by white space. The first column is the URL of the file as specified in the HTML of your game. The second column is the file's MIME type. The third column is the name of file on the local system to send when this file is requested. Files not beginning with a forward slash are relative to the directory containing the gamefile.

<p>If <b>awk</b> is installed on your system, the media file can be automatically generated from the <b>.jacl</b> game file using the <b>build-media-file</b> script in the <b>bin</b> directory of the JACL distribution. This script accepts the name of the game file as its only parameter and sends its output to standard out. It also asumes that all files live in an <b>images</b> directory beneath the directory containing the game file. <b>build-media-file</b> is used with a command like:

<pre>
 build-media-file grail.jacl > grail.media
</pre>

<p>JACL games played using the <b>fcgijacl</b> interpreter and a full webserver do not require a <b>.media</b> file. The path to the image specified in the HTML of your game will be looked for in the document root of your webserver.
