<h1><a class="title" name="definitions0">Definitions in Detail</a></h1>

<P>A JACL game file consists of two fundamental components: code and data. This chapter focuses on the data and provides a detailed break down of all the possible elements that may be defined. In the case of objects and locations, all their associated properties are also listed.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions1">Objects</a></h2>

<pre>
<b>object</B> <I>Label </I> <B>:</B> [<I>Name1 Name2 Name3</I>...]
  <b>plural</b>     <i>Name1</i> [<I>Name2 Name3 Name4</I>...]
  <B>has</B>        <I>Attribute1</I> [<I>Attribute2 Attribute3</I>...]
  <B>short</B>      <I>IndefiniteArticle ShortDescription</I>
  <B>definite</B>   <I>DefiniteArticle</I>
  <B>long</B>       <I>LongDescription</I> / <b>function</b>
  <B>parent</B>     <I>ItemLabel</I>
  <B>mass</B>       <I>Integer </I>/ <B>heavy </B>/ <B>scenery</b>
  <b>capacity</B>   <I>Integer</I>
  <b>player</b>
  <b>static</b>
</pre>

<P>Each object definition begins with the keyword <B>object</B> followed by the object's label. This label is a unique name by which the object will be referred to by any code within the program. The object's label is then followed by a space-delimited list of names. You may specify as many names as you can fit into a single line of JACL code, and if you do not specify any names, the object's label will be set as its one and only name. These are the names the player will use to refer to this object during the course of the game. For more information on object names, see the chapter on <a href="resolution.html">Object Resolution</a>.

<P>Following this header are any properties you wish to specify that pertain to the object that you are currently defining. Below is a description of all the possible object properties: 

<p>A <b>plural</b> keyword must be followed by a space-delimited list of one or more names that the player can use to refer to this object and others like it as a group. 

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>Be sure not to confuse this keyword with the attribute <b>PLURAL</b>. The attribute <b>PLURAL</b> is given to any object that, by itself, is considered to be plural. An example of this would be an object that represents a bunch of flowers. Objects that have <b>plural</b> names, on the other hand, may be singular objects, like a coin. If a coin is also given the name <b>coins</b> using the <b>plural</b> keyword, it can then be referred to as a group along with other objects that also have the plural name <b>coins</b>.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>If, for example, a game has two coins defined, a silver coin and a gold coin, and the player types <b>take coin</b>, the parser will ask the player which coin they are referring to. If each of the coins was given the plural name <b>coins</b>, and the player typed <b>take coins</b>, the parser would issue the take command for both coins. In a situation where there is more than one gold coin and more than one silver coin, this plural name can also be qualified by one of the object's other names. This is done with a command like <b>take gold coins</b>. This will cause the parser to issue the take command for all the objects present that have the plural name <b>coins</b> and also have the regular name <b>gold</b>. If the player had typed <b>take gold</b>, the parser would have asked the player which gold coin they were referring to, as without a plural name being used it assumes the intent was to refer to a single object.

<P>A <B>has</B> keyword must be followed by a space-delimited list of attributes that the object is to have when the game begins. For more information, see the chapter on <a href="attributes.html">Attributes</a>. If this property is omitted the object will start with no attributes.

<P>A <B>short</B> property must be followed by two parameters: the object's indefinite article and short description. The <I>ShortDescription</I> text, prefixed by the specified <I>IndefiniteArticle</I>, is displayed using the object's <B>{list}</B> macro in conjunction with a <B>write</B> command. When using the object's <B>{the}</B> macro, the <I>ShortDescription</I> text will normally be displayed prefixed with the word <B>the</B> or the specified definite article. If the word <B>name</B> is specified as the <I>IndefiniteArticle</I>, the <I>ShortDescription</I> text is not prefixed with anything, such as in the case of a proper noun. This applies to both the <B>{list}</B> and <B>{the}</B> macros. If the <I>ShortDescription</I> text is plural, the object should be given the attribute <B>PLURAL</B> to ensure that it is referred to appropriately by code in the library. If the <b>short</b> property is omitted, the <i>IndefiniteArticle</i> will be set to <B>the</B> and the <i>ShortDescription</i> will be set to the object's label. 
<p>A <b>definite</b> property is used to override the default of <b>the</b> that is output when using the object's <b>{the}</b> macro. This is only of use when writing games in languages other than English that have gender for inanimate objects.

<P>A <B>long</B> property is followed by the text to be displayed when the object is in the current location and the player types a <B>look</B> command. If this property is omitted, the object's label is used.

<table class="infowarn">
<TR><td><img src="info.png" alt="Information"></TD>
<td>If the text following a <B>long</B> property is the word <b>function</b>, the function <b>long</b> that is associated with this object will be executed whenever the long description text should be displayed. This provides the ability to have lengthy or dynamic descriptions.</td>
</tr></table>

<P>A <B>parent</B> property must be followed by either a location label (indicating that the object begins the game in that location), or an object label (indicating that the object begins the game within, on top of or being carried by that object). If the object's parent is set to <B>here,</B> or the <B>parent</B> keyword is omitted altogether, then the object will start in the nearest location defined above it in the game file.

<P>A <B>mass</B> property indicates the physical bulk of the object. It must be followed by an integer, the word <B>heavy</B> or the word <B>scenery</B>. An integer indicates exactly how much the object encumbers the player or fills a container (see the <B>capacity</B> property below for further information). The word <B>scenery</B> indicates that the object is immovable and that the interpreter should not display its long description after the location description. For this reason, no <B>long</B> property is required for object with a mass of <B>scenery</B>. The word <B>heavy</B> indicates that the object is immovable, but should have the text following its <B>long</B> description printed after the <B>look</B> function that is associated with its parent location is executed. If this property is omitted, the <B>mass</B> for the object is set to <B>scenery</B>.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png" alt="Information"></td>
<td>Behind the scenes, a <B>mass</B> of <B>heavy</B> translates to 99 and a <B>mass</B> of <B>scenery</B> translates to 100. It is important to keep this in mind if you change the <B>capacity</B> property for the player or create any containers.</td>
</tr></table>

<P>A <B>capacity</B> keyword must be followed by an integer, indicating the number of <B>mass</B> units an object with the attribute <B>CONTAINER</B>, <B>SURFACE</B> or <B>ANIMATE</B> can hold. If this property is omitted, the object will have a <b>capacity</b> of zero.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>Due to this property's default, any object that has the attribute <B>CONTAINER</B>, <B>SURFACE</B> or <B>ANIMATE</B> must also have a <B>capacity</B> property that is set to a suitably large value in order to allow an object to accept other objects. The exception to this rule is if the object being given or inserted has a <B>mass</B> of 0, but this value should only be used for insignificantly small objects.</td>
</tr></table>

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png" alt="Information"></td>
<td>In the file <B>frame.jacl</B> there is an object with the label <B>kryten</B> that is set up to represent the player. This item has a <B>capacity</B> of 42. If left unchanged, the player can not simultaneously carry objects whose <B>mass</B> properties total more than 42. This figure of 42 should be used as a guide when setting the <b>capacity</b> property of other characters, containers or surfaces and the <b>mass</b> of takeable objects.</td>
</tr></table>

<P>A <B>player</B> property has no parameters and indicates that this object is to represent the player in the game. Behind the scenes this sets the object pointer <b>player</b> to point to this object. The value of this pointer can be changed during the course of the game if required.

<p>The properties <b>bearing</b>, <b>velocity</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are used by the special-purpose commands <b>position</b>, <b>bearing</b> and <b>distance</b>. See the chapter on <a href="special.html#special">Special-Purpose Commands</a> for more information.

<P>The properties <B>next</B>, <B>previous</B>, <b>child</b>, <B>index</B>, <B>status</B>, <B>state</B>, <B>counter</B>, <B>points</B> and <b>class</b> have no pre-determined meaning for objects. You are free to set and test these values as required.

<P>When a command requires a numerical value as a parameter, the following object elements can be referred to:

<CENTER>
<table cellpadding=8><tr>
<td colspan=4><hr></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><I>object_label</I><B>(parent)</B></TD><td>0</td>
<td><I>object_label</I><B>(index)</B></TD><td>8</td>
</TR><TR>

</TR><TR>

<td><I>object_label</I><B>(state)</B></TD><td>10</td>
</TR><TR>

</TR><TR>

</TR><TR>

</tr><tr>
<td><I>object_label</I><B>(child)</B></TD><td>7</td>
<td><I>object_label</I><B>(y)</B></TD><td>15</td>
</tr><tr>
<td colspan=4><hr></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p> These elements can be referred to by name or index number. For example, the following two commands are equivalent:

<pre>
     set noun4(parent) = chest
     set noun4(10) = chest

     # ...and to iterate through all properties
     set INDEX = 0
     repeat
       write "PROPERTY " INDEX ": " noun4(INDEX)
       set INDEX + 1
     until INDEX = 16
</pre>

<p>If an object element is to be given a game-specific use, it is often wise to define a constant that describes its use. For example:

<pre>
     constant fuel_left	11     # 11 is the index of 'counter'

     {+accelerate
        set space_ship(fuel_left) - 1
        ...
     }
</pre>

<p>These constants can also be used to set the initial state of an object's properties. For example:

<pre>
     constant fuel_left	11     # 11 is the index of 'counter'

     object space_ship : space ship
       fuel_left    20
</pre>

<p>This code will set the element <b>space_ship(11)</b> to equal 20.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions2">Locations</a></h2>

<pre>
<B>location</B> <I>Label </I><B>:</B> [<I>Name1 Name2 Name3...</I>]
  <B>has</B>           <I>Attribute1</i> [<i>Attribute2 Attribute3</I>...]

  <b>in</B>            <I>LocationLabel </I>/ <B>nowhere</b>
  <b>out</B>           <I>LocationLabel </I>/ <B>nowhere</B>
  <b>static</b> 
</pre>

<P>Each location definition begins with the keyword <B>location</B>  followed by the location's label. This label is a unique name by which the location will be referred to by any code within the game file. The location's label is then followed by the location's space-delimited list of names. You may specify as many names as you can fit into a single line of JACL code, and if you do not specify any, the location's label will be set as its one and only name. These are the names the player will use to refer to this location during the course of the game. For more information, see the chapter on <a href="resolution.html">Object Resolution</a>.

<P>Following this header are any properties you wish to specify that pertain to the location you are currently defining. Below is a description of all the possible location properties: 

<P>A<B> has</B> keyword must be followed by a space-delimited list of attributes that the location is to have when the game begins. For more information, see the chapter on <a href="attributes.html">Attributes</a>. If this property is omitted, the only attribute the location will have when the game is started is <B>LOCATION</B>.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png" alt="Information"></td>
<td>Internally, objects and locations are both stored using the same data-structure. In fact, once the game is running, the only difference between the two is that a location has the attribute <B>LOCATION</B>.</td>
</tr></table>

<P>A <B>short</B> property must be followed by two parameters: the location's indefinite article and short description. The <I>ShortDescription</I> text, prefixed by the specified <I>IndefiniteArticle</I>, is displayed using the location's <B>{list}</B> macro in conjunction with a <B>write</B> command. When using the location's <B>{the}</B> macro, the <I>ShortDescription</I> text will normally be displayed prefixed with the word <B>the</B> or the specified definite article. If the word <B>name</B> is specified as the <I>IndefiniteArticle</I>, the <I>ShortDescription</I> text is not prefixed with anything, such as in the case of a proper noun. This applies to both the <B>{list}</B> and <B>{the}</B> macros. If the <I>ShortDescription</I> text is plural, the location should be given the attribute <B>PLURAL</B> to ensure the it is referred to appropriately by code in the library. If the <b>short</b> property is omitted, the <i>IndefiniteArticle</i> will be set to <B>the</B> and the <i>ShortDescription</i> will be set to the location's label. 

<P>The directions the player can travel in from this location are defined by the properties <B>north</B>, <B>northeast</B>, <B>northwest</B>, <B>south</B>, <B>southeast</B>, <B>southwest</B>, <B>east</B>, <B>west</B>, <B>up</B>, <B>down</B>, <B>in</B> and <B>out</B>. 

A direction property must be followed by the label of the location that the direction leads to when the game is started. The links between locations may be modified during the course of the game to reflect doors opening etc. The constant <B>nowhere</B> (0), may be used in place of a location label to indicate that the player may not move in that direction. If a direction is not listed, <B>nowhere</B> is the default.

<P>Following each completed location definition should be an associated function called <B>look</B>. This function will be executed every time the description for the location is due to be displayed.

<P>The properties <B>points</B> and <b>class</b> have no pre-determined meaning for locations. You are free to set and test these values as required.

<!-- NEW PAGE -->
<P>When a command requires a numerical value as a parameter, the following location elements can be referred to:

<p> These elements can be referred to by name or number. For example, the following two commands are equivalent:

<pre>
set noun4(west) = beach
set noun4(3) = beach

# ...or iterating across all directions to trap 
# the player in the current location
set INDEX = 0
repeat
  set here(INDEX) = nowhere
  set INDEX + 1
until INDEX = 12
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions3">Integer Variables</a></h2>

<P>Integer variables are defined using the keyword <B>integer</B> followed by the name of the variable. The starting value for the variable can be set by following the name of the variable with an integer or a previously defined constant. If no value is specified on definition, the variable is initialised with a value of zero.

<P>The following are some examples of variable definitions:

<pre>
constant DEFAULT_POWER     42

integer AIR_LEFT          100
integer LAGERS_DRUNK      ; Set to zero by default 
integer AIRLOCK_SEALED    true
integer MOTOR_POWER       DEFAULT_POWER 
</pre>

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>Like all other data definitions, variables can not be defined within the body of a function.</td>

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions4">Internal Integer Variables</a></h2>

<P>The following is a list of integer variables defined internally by the JACL interpreter.

<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=3 width=90%><tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>compass</B></TD>
<td>This variable is used to store the direction the player moved in when they travel between locations. This variable may be tested in either of the <B>movement</B> functions allowing you to prevent the move from occurring or displaying some special text as required. The direction travelled is encoded as an integer that can be compared to a set of constants. See the section on <a href="movement.html#movement3">Moving Non-player Characters</a> for details.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><td>
<B>total_moves</B></TD>
<td>This variable records the number of successful moves entered by the player so far. This variable starts at 0 and is incremented each time a valid command is entered by the player. This is indicated by the value of the variable <B>TIME</B> (see below).</TD>
</TR>
<TR><td>
<B>score</B></TD>
<td>This variable indicates how many points the player has scored during the course of the game.
</TR>
<TR><td>
<B>display_mode</B></TD>
<td>
<P>This variable indicates whether the interpreter is in <B>verbose</B> or <B>brief</B> mode, with a value of 1 being <B>verbose</B> and 0 being <B>brief</B>. The starting value is 0. In brief mode, each location is given the attribute <b>VISITED</b> when the player enters it, this is not the case when in verbose mode.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><td>
<B>internal_version</B></TD>
<td>This variable is set to the major version number of the JACL interpreter that you are using. This can be tested for in the <B>+intro</B> function to ensure compatibility between your game and the version of the interpreter being used to play it.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><td>
<B>time</B></TD>
<td>This variable is set to <B>true</B> when the player makes a move. If at no time during the processing of that move it is set to <B>false</B>, two things will happen.

<TR><td>
<B>max_rand</B></TD>
<td>When the word <B>random</B> is supplied as a parameter to a command expecting an integer value, a random number between one and the current value of <B>max_rand</B> will be generated. The default value is 100.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
</center>

<!-- NEW PAGE -->

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions5">String Variables</a></h2>

<P>String variables are defined using the keyword <b>string</b> in the same format as an <b>integer</b>. For example:

<pre>
string menu_title	"Options:"
</pre>

<p>Once defined, the value of a string can be output by passing the name of the variable as a parameter to a <b>write</b> statement. Strings have a maximum length of 256 bytes.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions6">Arrays</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to define more than one <b>integer</b> or <b>string</b> with the same name, thereby creating an array of values. Arrays can also be created by supplying more than one value during a single declaration. For example:

<pre>
integer FIBONACCI 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
integer FIBONACCI 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
</pre>

<p>The above code will create a single array of variables called <b>FIBONACCI</b> that contains 20 values. The number of values held by an array is fixed when the game is first executed and is referenced by using an at symbol (<b>@</b>) followed by the name of the array. Individual elements of an array are accessed by directly following the name of the array with a set of square brackets (<b>[ ]</b>) containing the index of the element. The first element of an array is at index 0. The following code displays the contents of the <b>FIBONACCI</b> array:

<pre>
integer INDEX

{+display_fibonacci
set INDEX = 0

repeat
   write FIBONACCI[INDEX] ^
   set INDEX + 1
until INDEX = @FIBONACCI
}
</pre>

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>In the above code, <b>@FIBONACCI</b> returns the number of elements in the array, which is one greater than the index of the last element. Take care when using this value to iterate over an array not to access the element <b>ARRAY[@ARRAY]</b>.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>This same technique can be applied to other data types such as strings. For example, consider the following code from <b>verbs.library</b>:

<pre>
string LCNumber zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
string UCNumber Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten

{+number_upper
if arg[0] &lt; 0 : arg[0] &gt; 10
   write arg[0]
else
   write UCNumber[arg[0]]
endif
}

{+number_lower
if arg[0] &lt; 0 : arg[0] &gt; 10
   write arg[0]
else
   write LCNumber[arg[0]]
endif
}
</pre>

<p>As it is possible to change the value of an <b>integer</b> and a <b>string</b> after they have been created, there is also a shortcut for creating arrays of variables with all elements being loaded with a default value. This is done by using the keywords <b>integer_array</b> or <b>string_array</b> followed by the name of the variable and the number of elements to create. For example, the following line of code will create an array of 10 integer variables called <b>OPTIONS</b>, all with the value <b>0</b>:

<pre>
integer_array OPTIONS 10
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to specify a custom default value after the size of the array like this:

<pre>
integer_array OPTIONS 10 42
</pre>

<p>This will create ten variable with the name <b>OPTIONS</b> and the value of <b>42</b>.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions7">Constants</a></h2>

<P>The basic syntax for a <B>constant</B> statement is:

<pre>
<b>constant</b> <i>ConstantName Value</i>
</pre>

<p>It is possible to define integer and string constants, the type being inferred from the value. If you would like to create a string constant that contains only a number, enclose the number in double quotes: Below is an example of creating constants. This example is taken from the beginning of The Unholy Grail and defines one integer and three string constants that contain the bibliographical information required by the Treaty of Babel:

<pre>
constant game_title     "The Unholy Grail"
constant game_author    "Stuart Allen"
constant game_version   2
constant ifid           "JACL-002"
</pre>

<p>Unlike a variable, the initial value of a constant is not an optional parameter. A value must be specified and this value will remain unchanged for the duration of the game.

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="info.png" alt="Information"></td>
<td>Although a variable can be used wherever a constant can be used, if a value is not to change during the game, there are two advantages to using a constant. The first is that the value cannot be changed by accident using a <b>set</b> command. The second is that constants are not saved each time the player makes a move so for this reason they also provide a performance increase over the use of variables.</td>

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions8">Synonyms</a></h2>

<P>Synonyms are a way of substituting a word in the player's move for another word. They are defined using the keyword <B>synonym</B> followed by the word to be substituted and then the word to be put in its place. Care should be taken when defining synonyms, as duplicate <B>grammar</B> statements are often the better approach. Consider the following examples:

<pre>
synonym get          take
synonym grab         take
</pre>

<P>With the above synonyms defined, the command 'get note' would be translated to 'take note' before being parsed. With the below <B>grammar</B> statements defined, but no synonyms in place, the command "get note" would be parsed as is, but will still be mapped to the <B>take</B> function.

<pre>
grammar take **here   &gt;take
grammar get **here    &gt;take
grammar grab **here   &gt;take
</pre>

<p>The problem with the synonym approach is that if we were then to define the following <B>grammar</B> statement, we would run into trouble:<br>

<pre>
grammar get out &gt;exit
</pre>

<P>With the above <b>synonym</b> defined, the command 'get out' would be translated to 'take out' before being parsed, a sentence that the game would not understand.

<P>There are right and wrong times to use both approaches to broadening your game's vocabulary. Just be sure to take care and consider the potential effects of any synonyms you define.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions9">Filters</a></h2>

<P>There are a few filters defined in <B>verbs.library</B>, and chances are you will never need to define any of your own. They are defined using the keyword <B>filter</B> followed by the word to be filtered from the player's input before it is parsed.

<P>The following are some examples of filter definitions (taken from <B>verbs.library</B>):

<pre>
filter the
filter quickly
</pre>

<P>With the above filters defined, if the player typed the command:

<pre>
quickly take the coin from the bag
</pre>

<P>the parser would process:

<pre>
take coin from bag
</pre>

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>Filters should be defined very sparingly. They are a designed to give the illusion of the parser understanding more than it really does. Although at times this can be good, at other times it can be very, very bad.</td>

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions10">Grammar Statements</a></h2>

<P>The basic syntax for a <B>grammar</B> statement is:

<pre>
<B>grammar</B> <I>MoveSyntax</I> <B>&gt;</B><I>FunctionName</I>
</pre>

<P>The keyword <B>grammar</B> defines a move that may be typed by the player and the function that will be executed when this move is made. The <I>MoveSyntax</I> section defines the syntax of the move and consists of one or more parameters that may either be a word to be typed verbatim or one of several special tokens. The last parameter of a <B>grammar</B> statement is a greater-than symbol directly followed by the core name of the function to be executed if a move of this format is typed by the player.

<p>The table below details the tokens that can be used as part of the <i>MoveSyntax</i>:

<p>
<center>
<table width=90%><tr>
<th>Token</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>*here</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an object in the current location must be supplied at this point in the move.</TD>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>**here</b></td>
<td>Indicates that one or more objects in the current location may be supplied at this point in the move.</TD>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>*held</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an object held by the player must be supplied at this point in the move.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<td><B>**held</b></td>
<td>Indicates that one or more objects held by the player must be supplied at this point in the move.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<td><b>*present</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an object either in the current location or held by the player must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>**present</b></td>
<td>Indicates that one or more objects either in the current location or held by the player must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>*anywhere</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an object anywhere in the game world must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>**anywhere</b></td>
<td>Indicates that one or more objects anywhere in the game world must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>*inside</b></td>
<td>This scope indicator can only be used as the second noun of verbs that have two nouns. It indicates that an object that is a child of the first noun must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>**inside</b></td>
<td>This scope indicator can only be used as the second noun of verbs that have two nouns. It indicates that multiple objects that are children of the first noun must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>*location</b></td>
<td>Indicates that a location in the game world must be specified at this point in the move.</td>
</tr><tr>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>$string</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an arbitrary text string must occur at this point in the move. If this text string is to contain spaces, the player must enclose the string in double quotes when typing their command.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><B>$integer</b></td>
<td>Indicates that an integer must be supplied at this point in the move.</td>
</tr></table>
</center>

<P>For example, the following are some valid <B>grammar</B> statements:

<pre>
grammar take **here                  &gt;take
grammar insert **held in *present    &gt;insert_in
grammar set *held to $integer        &gt;set_to
grammar type $string on *present     &gt;type_on
</pre>

<P>The first statement says that if the player types the word <b>take</b>, followed by one or more objects that are in the current location, then the function <B>take</B> should be executed. The second states that if the player types the word <b>insert</b>, followed by one or more objects that are being held, followed by the word <b>in</b>, followed by an object that is either being held or is in the current location, then the function <B>insert_in</B> should be executed. The third states that if the word <b>set</b> followed by a single object that is being held, followed by the word <b>to</b>, followed by an integer then execute the function <b>set_to</b>. Feel free to add extra <b>grammar</b> statements that map to library functions into your program. Keeping these extra <b>grammar</b> statements within the game-specific part of your code means that you can upgrade the library at a later date without needing to re-enter your additions. The exact way in which these functions are executed is detailed in the section on <a href="functions.html#functions3">Responding to Player's Moves</a>.

<p>When using the tokens <b>$integer</b> and <b>$string</b> the values entered by the player will be placed into constants of the same name. If a command contains two or more of the same token an array of constants will be created. For example:

<pre>
grammar send $string to $string    &gt;send_message

{+send_message
write "Sending " $string[0] " to " $string[1] "^."
}
</pre>

<table class="infowarn"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.png" alt="Warning"></td>
<td>When entering a new grammar definition, be sure not to leave a space between the greater-than symbol (<B>&gt;</B>) and the name of the function to be executed.</td>
</tr></table>

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions11">User Attributes</a></h2>

<P>The basic syntax for an <B>attribute</B> statement is:

<pre>
<b>attribute</B> <I>AttributeName</I> [<i>AttributeName AttributeName...</i>]
</pre>

<P>The keyword <B>attribute</B> defines a user attribute that can be used throughout your game for any custom purpose you require. Once a user attribute is defined, it is used in the exact same manner as a system attribute. You can define up to 32 user attributes.

<h2><a class="section" name="definitions12">Parameters</a></h2>

<P>Parameters are a web-based feature and therefore only be used with the <b>cgijacl</b> interpreters. The basic syntax for a <B>parameter</B> statement is:

<pre>
<B>parameter</B> <I>ParameterName</I> [<I>Container</I>] [<I>LowestValue HighestValue</I>]
</pre>

<p>A <b>parameter</b> is a connection between an HTML form parameter and a JACL container or string. When a defined parameter is passed, its value is copied into the specified container or string before the player's move is processed. A group of two integers may also be specified after the container in the parameter definition. These numbers indicate the parameter's range bounds if it the container is for storing integers. The first integer is the lowest possible value for the parameter, the second is its highest. When a parameter is updated, it will automatically be adjusted to fall within the supplied bounds if required. If no low and high range bounds are specified, they are set to -65535 and 65535 respectively.

<p>Below is a complete JACL program demonstrating the use of <b>parameter</b> statement in combination with an HTML form.

<pre>
#!../bin/cgijacl

parameter TEST  kryten(status)          1       4
parameter PASSWORD password

location thehere : here

integer INDEX
string password

{form
write "STATUS: " kryten(status) ^
write "PASSWORD: " password ^
write "&lt;hr&gt;"
write "&lt;form&gt;"
hidden

set INDEX = 1
repeat
   write "&lt;input type=radio name=TEST value=~" INDEX ~
   if INDEX = kryten(status)
      write " checked" endif
   write "&gt;" INDEX
   set INDEX + 1
   write "^"
until INDEX = 5

write "&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=~password~ name=~PASSWORD~&gt;^"
write "&lt;input type=submit&gt;"

write "&lt;/form&gt;^"
}

object kryten : myself
  player

{+intro
execute here.form
}

grammar blankjacl &gt;form
</pre>

<p>When accessed, this program will look as follows in a web browser:

<center>
<p><img src="forms.png">
</center>

<p>Selecting one of the radio buttons and entering text in the password input field then clicking the submit button will cause the value of <b>kryten(status)</b> and <b>password</b> to be updated before the player's command is processed. As there is no move to process, a <b>blankjacl</b> command is proxied on the players behalf. This command has been mapped to the <b>form</b> function, which re-displays the form.
