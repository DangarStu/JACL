<h1><a class="title" name="csv0">CSV Files</a></h1>

<p>A comma-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. Each column in the file is, as the name suggests, separated by commas. JACL supports both the reading and writing of CSV files. By default, CSV files are stored in a directory named <b>data</b> in the same location as the program that is accessing them. For example, the demonstration program <b>contacts.jacl</b> lives in the <b>projects</b> directory and stores its data in <b>projects/data</b>.

When referring to a CSV file using any of the commands detailed in this section only a portion of the filename is specified. This supplied name is used to build the full name of the file using the following formula:

<pre>
<i>&lt;DataDirectory&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;ProgramName&gt;</i><b>-</b><i>&lt;Name&gt;</i><b>.csv</b>
</pre>

<p>For example, the program <b>contacts.jacl</b> stores its contacts in a CSV file called <b>data</b> which translates to the full file:</p>

<pre>
<b>projects/data/contacts-data.csv</b>
</pre>

<p>This system ensures that no two JACL programs can overwrite each others data or access arbitrary files from the filesystem of the webserver.</p>

<h2><a class="section" name="csv1">The ITERATE and ENDITERATE Commands</a></h2>

<P>Any <B>ITERATE</B> command must be of the following format:

<pre>
<B>iterate</B> <I>&lt;FileName&gt;</I> [<b>skip_header</b>]
...
<b>enditerate</b>
</pre>

<P>The <B>iterate</B> and <b>enditerate</b> commands mark a looping block of code. The block of code is run once for each row in the file specified directly after the <b>iterate</b> command. For example, the <b>+intro</b> function of the program <b>contacts.jacl</b> loops through the file <b>data</b> and looks for the last (highest) ID already assigned to a contact. This number is stored so that the next contact created can be given an ID that one higher, and therefore unqiue:

<pre>
# GET THE LAST ID
iterate data
   if field[0] &lt; last_id
      set last_id = field[0]
   endif
enditerate
</pre>

<p>Each column of the currect row being read is loaded into a string array called <b>field</b>. In the case of <b>contacts.jacl</b>, the ID is stored in the first column, or field.</p>

<p>Below is another example of the <b>iterate</b> command, this time it is used to display the entire contents of the file <b>data</b>:

<pre>
iterate data skip_header
  set INDEX = 0
  while INDEX &lt; field_count
    write field[INDEX]
    write ", "
    set INDEX + 1
  endwhile
  write "^"
enditerate
</pre>

<p>There are two points of note with this second example. The first is that the optional flag <b>skip_header</b> has been specified after the file name. This flag tells the <b>iterate</b> command to ignore the first line of the file as it contains column headers, not data. For example, a CSV such as this:</p>

<pre>
ID    First name        Last name
0     Stuart            Allen
1     Fred              Fargnargle
2     Zaphod            Beeblebrox
</pre>

<p>The second is the constant <b>field_count</b>. This constant contains the number of columns read for the current row. JACL supports a maximum of twenty columns for any given row.

<h2><a class="section" name="csv2">The UPDATE, ENDUPDATE and INSERT Commands</a></h2>

<P>Any <B>update</B> command must be of the following format:

<pre>
<B>update</B> <I>&lt;FileName&gt;</I>
...
<b>endupdate</b>
</pre>

<p>Any <b>insert</b> command must be of the following format:

<pre>
<B>insert</B> <I>&lt;Field0&gt;</I> [<I>&lt;Field1&gt;</I>...]
</pre>

<p>The <b>update</b> is used to re-write a CSV and therefore provide the opportunity to edit the contents. 
Below is an example of its use from the <b>+update</b> function of <b>contacts.jacl</b>

<pre>
update data
   if field[0] = $integer
      insert field[0] firstname_data surname_data email_data home_phone_data mobile_phone_data address_data
   else
      insert field[0] field[1] field[2] field[3] field[4] field[5] field[6]
   endif
endupdate
write "Record " $integer " updated.^^"
</pre>

<p>This function uses the <b>update</b> command to modify the details for the contact with the ID (<b>field[0]</b>) that is equal to <b>$integer</b>. This is achieved by looping through each line of the file (using the <b>update</b> command) and then checking if the current line is the line that is to be edited. If so, the new values are written out (using the <b>insert</b> command). If not, the existing values are written back to the file (also using the <b>insert</b> command.)</p>

<p>The <b>update</b> and <b>insert</b> commands are also used to delete a record in <b>contacts.jacl</b>. This is achieved by inserting all the existing rows from within an <b>update</b> loop except the record to be deleted:

<pre>
update data
   if field[0] != $integer
      insert field[0] field[1] field[2] field[3] field[4] field[5] field[6]
   endif
endupdate
write "Record " $integer " deleted.^^"
</pre>

<h2><a class="section" name="csv3">The APPEND Command</a></h2>

<p>Any <b>append</b> command must be of the following format:

<pre>
<B>append</B> <I>&lt;FileName&gt;</I> <I>&lt;Field0&gt;</I> [<I>&lt;Field1&gt;</I>...]
</pre>

<p>The <b>append</b> command is used to write a single extra row to the end of a CSV file. If the CSV file doesn't already exist it will be created and the appended row written to the new file. Below is an example of its use from the <b>+add_record</b> function of <b>contacts.jacl</b>:

<pre>
set last_id + 1
append data last_id firstname_data surname_data email_data home_phone_data mobile_phone_data address_data
write firstname_data " " surname_data " added to database.^^"
</pre>
