<h1><a class="title" name="verbfunctions0">Appendix B: Library Verb Functions</a></h1>

<P>Below is a list of all the functions that are associated with <B>grammar</B> statements in <b>verbs.library</b>. It is not, however, a complete list of all the possible command constructs the player can use. Although each function is only listed here once, in most cases there are many <B>grammar</B> statements mapping to that function. For example, consider the function <B>+cut</B>: 

<pre>
grammar cut *present  &gt;cut
grammar chop *present &gt;cut
grammar stab *present &gt;cut
</pre>

<P>As you can see, the function <B>cut</B> has three <B>grammar</B> statements that map to it. The list below, however, will only show the first <B>grammar</B> statement that maps to the function. To see all the commands that will cause any one of the below functions to be called, search for the function name in the <B>verbs.library</B> file.
